    "How to test the independence of two categorical variables? It will be done using the Chi-square test of independence.\n",

    "As will all prior statistical tests we need to define null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "The null hypothesis is what is assumed to be true until we have evidence to go against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are interested in researching if two categorical variables are related or associated (i.e. dependent).  Therefore, until we have evidence to suggest that they are we must assume that they are not.  This is the motivation behind the hypothesis for the Chi-square Test of Independence:\n",
    "\n",
    "H0: In the population, the two categorical variables are independent.\n",
    "Ha: In the population, two categorical variables are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have gathered our data we summarize the data in the two-way contingency table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This table represents the observed counts and is called the Observed Counts Table or simply the Observed Table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, under the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent, what would we expect to find in our data if the two variables (e.g. Party Affiliation and Opinion) were not related?  \n",
    "We need to find what is called the Expected Counts Table or simply the Expected Table.  \n",
    "This table displays what the counts would be for our sample data if there were no association between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Expected Counts from Observed Counts\n",
    "Once we have the observed counts we need to compute the expected counts under the null hypothesis that the two categorical variables are independent.  This is done using the marginal totals and overall total to compute expected counts for each cell of the table.  In words, to find the expected count for each cell in the table we take multiply the marginal row and column totals for that cell and divide by the overall total.  Formulaically for each cell this is:\n",
